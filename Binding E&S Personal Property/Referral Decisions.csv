• Please do not add BWH0141
• GL obtained and maintained
• Excluding liability
• Include Total Business Exclusion - please make sure insured is aware of the severe restrictions of this form for an in home business.  If any loss occurs related to the business, claims will deny the loss.  (e.g. A bottle warmer used for a daycare child shorts out, starts a fire and the house burns to the ground. Claims would deny all damage to the home and contents.)

Your email says “on premises”.  If it takes place in a separate building, terms would still be the same but we would add a subjectivity:  Building exclusion applies for building where daycare takes place.

• What is the insured’s occupation and is he generally around outside of his work hours or is he traveling?  (I wondered if maybe he was never around and he’s making pretty good money renting out rooms to students.)  
• What is the named insured so I can note my log.  
• As we discussed, there is a competitor premium of $4,800 (appx $0.90).  Our quoted rental premium is well below this and we are looking at an owner occupied policy.  You suggested a premium of about $3,800, which is about $1,000 more than quoted, correct?

Unfortunately, the shop is actually part of Coverage A, so in essence we’d be excluding coverage for the entire home and shop structures.  That won’t do the insured any good.  And I’m not comfortable going forward without the exclusion.

I’m definitely wondering why the retail agent didn’t mention this business to us, especially since they write the commercial.  It’s a pretty big concern!  I’m glad we found out, because our HO-3 mainly excludes business in Other Structures, so I’m not sure our policy exclusions would have applied, and we would surely want them to.

If the shop was detached from the home, we could call it Coverage B and then our Total Business Exclusion would be more clear cut.  I’m sure they could more easily get it added to the commercial policy.  That might be something to consider if they have trouble getting coverage.

Currently used for business purposes.  Possible plan to apply for a loan for renovations, but no guaranty this will happen. (May not be able to with their score, and it hasn't happened yet.)

Based on current use as business, the fact it has been vacant possibly for 3 years, and the fact that we don't have solid plans in process to renovate for occupancy, I would say this best belongs on a commercial policy.

My guess is it might be in the midst of renovation and they ran out of money.  (No running water?)  Or they've been applying for loans and have been unsuccessful and decided to use it as an office vs. leaving it empty.

• Could we please have more information on the plumbing leak detector that was installed. Brand name? How does it work?
• What is the current status of demolition and/or repair of the interior?  
• Are there any areas remaining in the interior that were damaged by water or has everything been torn out?
• Has any mold testing been done?
• There is no surcharge for losses on the rater?  Per the app, there are 2.
